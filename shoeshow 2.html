<pre>Proposal for Diplo's House continues in a line of Pop Gun exhibitions
self-reflexively exploring the role of
the exhibition in an artist's practice. Staged as a showroom, in a downtown Miami
highrise apartment, the
exhibition sees eight artists proposing works to be acquired by the superstar DJ,
Diplo. Similar to a public
art proposal, in which an artist considers the contextual aspects of an installation
site, here the artists are
tasked to consider Diplo's private collection. While a 2024 Architectural Digest
tour of Diplo's Jamaican
Jungle villa offers a rudimentary sense of site, the question of what art would Diplo
like for his collection?
may be further explored with inquiries into Diplo the person, and even Diplo the
character.
Pop Gun is an artist-run project space. Its noncommercial programming centers
around emerging
conceptual practices, bound by a scrappy DIY-ethos.
Aruga Fine Arts is an artist-run apartment gallery in Miami, FL. Started by Karla
Zurita, Aruga offers an
exhibition program subversive to the economy and aesthetics of design.
